# Concept

gorift is a package in order to discover, monitor, and pick the backend servers.

Extendability: It is difficult for load balancers to control behaviors using config files only because of various middleware to involve. Therefore, it leaves spaces to inject your custom APIs depending on your situation.

RPC client/server libraries to dispatch requests to backend servers using gorift will be prepared as another one.
